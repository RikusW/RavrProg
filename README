RavrProg is for programming AVR controllers.

Currently ISP and ATmega Jtag programming is implemented and tested.
HVPP and HVSP fuse programming should work, flash and eeprom read/write code was not tested but may work.


STK500 code was tested on my U2S clone.
STK600 code was written but not tested.
AVRISP mkI use the same code as the STK500.
AVRISP mkII was tested with the LUFA clone.
JTAGICE mkI was tested on my clone.
JTAGICE mkII code was tested using my dragon.
USBasp is not implemented yet.
LUFACDC code still needs testing.
